# LongReadAccuracyVerification
Using k-mer seeds to compare the accuracy of long read alignments to that of short reads

Requirements:

The experiment within this repository requires the following:
[sra-toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit)
[samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools)

The python scripts also require the packages:
[pysam](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
[biopython](https://biopython.org/)


### VERY IMPOTANT ###
The shell scripts wrapped in the python will not work on Windows. 
So this can only work on Linux or Mac.
